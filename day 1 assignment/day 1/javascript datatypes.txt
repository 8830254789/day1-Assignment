One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. 
These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language. 
JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types: 
•	Numbers, e.g., 123, 120.50 etc. 
•	Strings of text, e.g. "This text string" etc. 
•	Boolean, e.g. true or false. 
JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, 
JavaScript supports a composite data type known as object. We will cover objects in detail in a separate chapter.
Java does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values. 
JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard.
